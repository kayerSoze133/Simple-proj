        <p>LED stands for Light Emitting Diode and it is the relatively new, and cost effective way to illuminate the
            world
            around us <br>They were too expensive and they didnâ€™t give out enough illumination to make the cost
            worthwhile.

            Now the research and development of this green technology has caught up with expectations, bulb prices have
            come down and they are giving out enough light to compete with CFLs and incandescent alternatives. </p>
